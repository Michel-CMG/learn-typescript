### Learn Typescript by deno

Use deno to learn the typescript. I think deno is much more simple than node.js for learning typescript.

  - Install deno from deno.land
    - Just copy the single file deno to your home
    - Add the env var in your shell config(such as .bashrc)
  - deno run .ts files and deno test .ts files
  - Happy!

This is also for everyday commit and everyday habit building.<br>
The idea is from Stephen Guise's book **Mini Habits**. Recommend to search the idea or just read the book.
